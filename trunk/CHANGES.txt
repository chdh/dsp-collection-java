Changes
-------

2015-05-27
- DFT class added.

2014-03-13
- Float-Support for WAV files added.
  The current JDK is very buggy with floating-point support for WAV files.
  Writing a floating-point WAV file sets the wrong encoding type in the header.
  AudioInputStream.getFrameLength() returns the size in bytes instead of the size in frames.
  See my bug reports:
